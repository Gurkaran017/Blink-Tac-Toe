# Blink Tac Toe 🎮

A fun twist on Tic Tac Toe where emojis disappear after 3 turns!

## Tech Stack
- **React** with Vite (fast builds)
- **Tailwind CSS** (stylish design)
- Custom hooks for game logic

## Emoji Categories
Players choose from:
- 🐶 Animals (Dog, Cat, Monkey...)  
- 🍕 Food (Pizza, Burger, Donut...)  
- ⚽ Sports (Soccer, Basketball, Tennis...)  
- ✈️ Travel (Plane, Car, Rocket...)  
- ☀️ Weather (Sun, Rain, Rainbow...)

## Vanishing Feature
- Each player can only have **3 emojis** at once  
- When placing a 4th emoji:  
  1. Oldest emoji disappears (like a queue)  
  2. New emoji takes its place  
- **Bonus**: Shows glowing borders on newest/oldest emojis

## With More Time, I'd Add:
- [ ] Online multiplayer  
- [ ] Hover over a category to see all its emojis (🐶🐱🐭)
